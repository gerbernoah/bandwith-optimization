# Bandwith Optimization

Network Optimization – ETH Zürich Spring 2025
Optimization Methods for Engineers (227-0087-00L)

This project applies advanced optimization techniques to solve a real-world network flow optimization problem. Developed as part of the ETH Zürich course Optimization Methods for Engineers (Spring Semester 2025), the implementation explores both exact and approximate methods to optimize routing cost and bandwidth under various constraints.
